== Introduction ==

Wsiwaf is an extension to waf that is designed to create a build environment
for the creation of Writing System Implementations. Such implementations
are made up of a number of key elements: fonts, keyboards, sort orders.

=== Installation ===

Installing wsiwaf is simple. It consists of copying the wsiwaf file to a
suitable directory, usually the project directory where it can be shared within
any version control system. In addition a file `wscript` needs to be created
to control the build process. This wscript file is in fact a python program
but the way it is run is designed to hide that as much from the unsuspecting
user as possible. Thus only those who want to get into the programming aspects
need do.

In terms of necessary tools that wsiwaf makes use of, the details are listed
in the parts of documentation specific to the tools that get used.

=== Execution ===

The heart of the build system is the `wscript` file that controls the build
process. This is done by the python program creating a set of wsi component
objects. The system then takes these objects and allows the user to run various
build commands.

waf, on which wsiwaf is built, works by creating a build directory
into which all the results are stored. This leaves the source directories
pristine and makes for easy clearing up. The build directory is created using
the command:

----
wsiwaf configure
----

This process creates the build directory, checks that all the tools that wsiwaf
needs to achieve the build as described in `wscript` are available, and sets
up various internal environment variables. Thus if any changes are made to the
`wscript` that change what tools are needed, then the `configure` command needs
to be rerun.

After configuration it is possible to build the system. This is done using:

----
wsiwaf build
----

This creates the final release forms of the various components that are to be
built. For example, it will create any fonts or keyboards. But it does not
create any installers, these need another command:

----
wsiwaf exe
----

This creates the installers described by the various package objects. In turn
it also builds everything as specified by `wsiwaf build`.

----
wsiwaf pdfs
----

This creates font tests output as pdf.

----
wsiwaf svg
----

This creates svg test results for fonts.

----
wsiwaf zip
----

Creates a zip appropriate for a source package.
