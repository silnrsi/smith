=== Installing smith and its dependencies ===

There are 2 ways to install the smith toolchain: rely on the packages (build from master/main) and the smith Docker image to do all the installation and the configuration for you, or build the various components yourself from source directly. We recommend the first option.

We are using Ubuntu for the smith toolchain. 

The steps are described in more details on https://silnrsi.github.io/silfontdev/

The docker image is built from the Dockerfile at the root of the smith project: https://github.com/silnrsi/smith

Previous manual steps present in this section of the manual have been removed because they have not been maintained.
Please use the steps in the Dockerfile and the dependency definitions in the docker/ folder of the smith repository instead if you'd like to do it manually.
