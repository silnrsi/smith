== Directory Structure ==

Having a good layout for all the different files in a script project is very helpful.

A reference template structure is in preparation, for now the following structure description is provided:

=== Create Working Area ===

If you need a suggestion of where to place all the needed files, the following directory structure is suggested.

Create a directory to work in. We will use the directory `projects`. You can call this directory whatever you want and put it wherever you like, just remember to adjust the following instructions accordingly. Your home folder is a good place for this directory.

In `projects` create a directory called `script`. In `fontwork` place Perl sources (either from CPAN tarballs or repositories) and other miscellaneous files. In `script` there should be one directory for each script. The directory name should be the ISO 15924 four-letter code for the script you are working with. For example `deva` for Devanagari, `latn` for Latin (or Roman) script.

=== Script Projects ===

These projects are named for the ISO 15924 four letter codes mentioned above. While it isn't necessary to follow the script project directory structure when using the font template build system, it is a useful directory structure.

fonts/::
    Contains one directory per font project in this script

keyboards/::
    Contains one directory per keyboard layout collection

mappings/::
    Contains one directory per legacy encoding. Inside that is any mapping tables and a sample font in that encoding.

wsis/::
    Each directory under here corresponds to a particular language that uses script. The directory name is the RFC4646bis code for the language. Each language directory in its turn contains other directories:

words/:::
    This directory contains Unicode encoded wordlist files

cldr/:::
    This directory contains any LDML files for this language in this writing system

toolbox/:::
    This directory contains any Toolbox `.lng` files for this language and script in Unicode. Non-Unicode files are stored under a corresponding directory in the appropriate `mappings` directory.

texts/:::
    Contains sample texts in the language, including `.pdf` to show how the text should be rendered.
