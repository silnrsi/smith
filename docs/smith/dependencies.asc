== Dependencies ==

There are two ways to install the smith toolchain and its many dependencies: rely on the packages (build from master/main) and the smith Docker image to do all the installation and the configuration for you, or build the various components yourself directly from source. We highly recommend the first option.

We are using https://ubuntu.com[Ubuntu] as the base layer for the entire smith toolchain.

The steps are described in more details in the SIL Font Development Guide on https://silnrsi.github.io/silfontdev/

The docker image is built from the Dockerfile at the root of the https://github.com/silnrsi/smith[smith project repository] which in turn uses various files in `docker/`.

Manual steps previously described in this section of the manual have been removed because they got out of date too quickly. Please use the steps in the Dockerfile and the dependency definitions in the `docker/` folder of the smith repository instead, if you'd like to do it manually.
