== Keyboards ==

Keyboard objects (`kbd()`) are much simpler than fonts. There are a number of attributes associated with a keyboard and they are listed here along with their default values:

source::
    The source file is a Keyman keyboard source file with extension `.kmn`. (Required)

target::
    The target file is the compiled Keyman keyboard and defaults to the source `.kmn` file with kmn replaced as `.kmx`

The following are attributes specific to generating a sample layout of the keyboard:

font::
    Font filename to use for rendering the layout (required).

fontname::
    Public font name that is used by the OS to reference the font.

fontdir::
    Directory containing the font specified in `font`. This defaults to `kbdfonts`.

kbdfont::
    Full pathname to font file to use for rendering the layout. By default this is built from the `font` and `fontdir` attributes.

fontsize::
    Font size to render glyphs at in the layout, given in pt (18).

modifiers::

    A list of strings which can take a sequence of the following strings, for example 'Ctrl RAlt'

        '';;
            The empty string to indicate no modifier

        Ctrl;;
            Can be modified by L or R as well, as in LCtrl, RCtrl, Ctrl

        Alt;;
            Can be further modified by L or R or Gr, as in Alt, LAlt, RAlt, AltGr (equivalent to RAlt)

        key;;
            This specifies a key that is to be considered pressed before the keytop. This is used
            to document keyboard layouts following a deadkey. For example '[K_BKSLASH]' or '\\' which
            are equivalent.
pdf::
    Filename to put keyboard layout pdf in ('source'.pdf)

svg::
    Intermediate svg format of keyboard layout ('source'.svg)

xml::
    Intermediate xml that represents the basic keystrokes of the keyboard ('source'.xml)

mskbd::
    An object that describes how to create an MS keyboard from the .kmn file.

An example specification of a keyboard object might be:

[source,python]
----
kbd(source = 'mykbd.kmn',
    fontname = 'My Font',
    font = 'results/myfont.ttf')
----

=== mskbd ===

The mskbd object can be used for the mskbd parameter of a keyboard. It automatically generates
a normal MS Keyboard from the .kmn file and compiles it. The dependencies are pretty stiff, but
it does mean that a complete MS solution can be generated without needing to run special GUI
software during the development cycle. The parameters to mskbd() are:

lid::
    Language LCID to store this keyboard under. If not specified, defaults to 0xC00.

lidinstall::
    Specified as a list of language ids to install this keyboard under. E.g. lidinstall=[0x0436].

guid::
    GUID to associate with the keyboard. If not specified a random one is created.

capslockkeys::
    A list of keytops that should have capslock enabled for them. That is capslock will have
    a shift action (and shift will unshift). The keytop characters are:
    abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789-=[];',./\`

The following are internal attributes that may be set:

arches::
    List of architectures that may be built for. Currently i586 and amd64. This is unlikely to be set by a user.

source::
    .kmn source file, defaults to keyboard .source attribute

c_file::
    .c file to generate (same as source but with .c extension)

rc_file::
    .rc file to generate (same as source but with .rc extension)

o_file::
    .o file to generate from .c file (same as source but with .o extension)

dll::
    .dll file to create (same as source but with .dll extension)

=== Tests ===

There are currently no automated tests for keyboards, although the generation of the layout can be considered a test.
