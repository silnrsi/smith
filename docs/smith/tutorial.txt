= Smith Tutorial -

== Tutorial ==

In this tutorial we will examine a number of wscript files. The first section is
the largest and builds up a complex font creation scenario from humble
beginnings.

=== Font Creation ===

==== font1 - Simplicity ====
We start with a simple, single font.

[source,python,numbered]
----
include::../../smith-playground/tutorial/font1/wscript[]
----

Due to the way the tutorial is structured, we keep the shared source files in a
different directory tree. Line 1 sets up where that tree is.

In line 2, we create a new font object that we want the system to build. We
specify the target filename. This file will be created in the build tree
(`buildlinux2` on linux). Line 3 specifies where to find the source file. Notice
that the target file is a `.ttf` file while the source is a `.sfd` file. Smith
will do the necessary commands to convert from one to the other.

With this as our `wscript` file, we can build our font:

----
smith configure
----

This is the first step in building any project. This command tells smith to set
up the build environment and search out all the programs that it may need for
the various tasks we may ask of smith. If a necessary program is missing smith
will stop at that point and indicate an error. Some programs are not strictly
necessary and smith can run with reduced function without them. Such missing
programs are listed in orange. All other programs that smith searches for and
finds are listed, along with their locations, in green. So you can see exactly
which program smith will use for any particular task.

----
smith build
----

This command tells smith to go and build all the objects the `wscript` says to
be built. In this case just the simple `Loma.ttf` which will appear in
`buildlinux2`. Not very exciting, but a good start.

==== font2 - Multiple fonts ====

Most font packages consist of more than one font file and this project is no
exception. Can we scale our project to handle more than one file?

[source,python,numbered]
----
include::../../smith-playground/tutorial/font2/wscript[]
----

This example shows the power of integrating a description with a full
programming language. `wscript` files are python programs, all be it very
enhanced ones. So we can use any python type constructs we might need. Usually
the need is slight, and we show a typical example here.

Line 3 is the start of a loop. The lines below that are indented within the loop
will be repeated for each value in the list. The first value is nothing (well
the empty string `''`) and the second is `-Bold`. Each time around the loop, the
variable `ext` is set to the appropriate string. We will then use that variable
to help set the appropriate values in the two font objects we are creating.

Each time around the loop, we create a new font object. In line 4 we create a
new font object whose target font file's name is dependent on the `ext` variable
which is set to the various strings from the list at the start of the loop. So
we will end up creating two fonts. One called `Loma.ttf` as before, and one
called `Loma-Bold.ttf`. Line 5 gives the source files for each of these fonts.

It may seem easier just to expand out the loop and have two `font()` object
commands, but as the complexity of this `font()` grows, we will see the value of
using a loop. The advantage of adding the loop early is that we can make
appropriate use of `ext`.

Now when we come to build this project, we will get two fonts:

----
smith configure
smith build
----

==== font3 - Packaged ====

It's good that we can create multiple fonts, but what do we do with them then?
There are two typical products that people want from a font project: a `.zip`
file containing the fonts and a `.exe` Windows installer that allows someone to
simply run the program to install the fonts. Smith can create these two products
from a wscript, but it needs just a little more information to do so:

[source,python,numbered]
----
include::../../smith-playground/tutorial/font3/wscript[]
----

Line 1 gives the base name of the products that will be created and line 2 gives
the version of that product. Notice that the version variable is a string and
does not have to be numeric. Case is important here, these are, in effect, magic
variables we are setting that smith looks up.

To build this project, we do the same as before, but we can also use two extra
commands:

----
smith configure
smith build
smith zip
smith exe
----

`smith zip` will create `loma-0.0.1.zip` in the `buildlinux2` subdirectory.
This zip file contains the two target fonts the build created. `smith exe`
creates a Windows installer, and in keeping with naming conventions for
installers, the APPNAME has been title cased to produce `Loma-0.0.1.exe`.
We will go into much more detail on packaging in the packaging tutorial section.

==== font4 - Internal processing ====

Before our example gains smart font support and grows in complexity, there is
one area of control that is worth examining. For the most part, when creating a
`wscript` one fills in the various 'forms' that create the objects, and smith
knows what needs to happen to make things turn out right. But while this makes
for pretty tutorials, real world projects have unique quirks that require the
ability to add commands into the processing or to create things dynamically. In
this exercise we will add a process to the source font:

[source,python,numbered]
----
include::../../smith-playground/tutorial/font4/wscript[]
----

The interest lies in line 10. Here we use a `process()` function to tell smith
that we want it to run a command over the source font before converting it to a
`.ttf`. A `process()` function takes a file which already exists (either in the
source tree or one that is generated by another process) and then runs the list
of `cmd()` function results over it in order. In this case the command is to run
a script that removes overlap from all the glyphs in the font. The command
string takes some study. The program takes two command line parameters, an input
font file and an output font file. We represent these in the command string by
`${DEP}` (the dependent file) as the input and `${TGT}` as the output file.
smith will fill these in appropriately when it comes to run the command. In
addition, note the initial `'../'` at the start of the command string. This is
because all commands in smith are run from the `buildlinux2` directory and so we
have to go up one level to get back to the project root where the `wscript` file
is and then from there we can navigate to the actual remove overlap script.

The rest of the new lines in this exercise are simply extra variables being used
to make the file easier to read, otherwise some of the lines would become
excessively long and confusing. Notice that all the magic variables in a
`wscript` that smith considers are all caps. That is if you use a variable name
with a lowercase letter in it, you are sure to be safe from smith assuming some
special meaning to that variable.

For the most part we are not very intersted in precisely what smith is doing to
get the results we want. But sometimes it helps to know, and all that cryptic
output streaming by isn't much help. But there is a way to get something more
helpful. First we need to get back to a completely pristine source tree:

----
smith distclean
----

Now we can configure and run in a way that has smith tell us what it is doing:

----
smith configure
smith build -j1 -v
----

In my case, here were my results:

----
$ smith build -j1 -v

Thankfully, on a modern terminal, the colourising helps makes more sense of the
volumenous information. But it is helpful once you learn to read it. The
timestamped `runner` lines give the precise command lines that are run at each
stage of the build.

Clearly the key to getting this output is in the command line options to `smith build`.
The `-v` says to output the extra information. But since smith tries to use multiple
processors if you have them, to speed up the build (for example without the
`-j1`, my build runs in 0.479s), it means the output can get interleaved. It is
therefore wise to restrict smith to a single process while outputting this
information, and this is done using `-j1`.

==== font5 - Smarts and Basic Tests ====

In this exercise we grow our description to add opentype and graphite tables and
also add some tests.

[source,python,numbered]
----
include::../../smith-playground/tutorial/font5/wscript[]
----

Line 14 tells smith how the OpenType tables will be generated for this font. It
is possible to compile in Volt tables, or, as here to use the internal
description already in the font. The `internal()` does very little, but it does
indicate to smith that the font has OpenType tables and that they should be
tested.

Line 15 tells smith how the Graphite tables are to be added. There is currently
only one form for Graphite source, and that is GDL. The `gdl()` object tells
smith how to generate and bring together the various files that typically make
up a Graphite description. A typical graphite project has an autogenerated
component (which is the first parameter to the gdl() (`fbase+'.gdl'`) and a
common core gdl file that is hand authored (the `master` parameter). smith then
does the work to generate the files and compile them into the font.

Line 16 talks about an attachment point database. This file holds information
about glyphs in the font that cannot be held by TTF. Most importantly this file
holds the positions of anchor points on the glyphs, and these positions are used
when autogenerating smart code, either for volt() or gdl() or whatever.
Depending on the source file format, the file may be autogenerated or be
required as part of the source files.

These three lines are all it takes to add a sophisticated smart font build
system to the font creation. The rest of this section will look at basic font
testing.

The basic principle of font testing in smith is that there is a test directory
containing test data. This data is then applied to the various fonts and results
are generated in the build tree. Test data can be of various formats, but the
easiest to work with is simple `.txt` files that are treated as one paragraph
per line files.

Line 7 gives the directory where the test files may be found. Since it is
outside the project tree rooted in the directory containing the wscript, we have
to specify where in the buildtree we want the test results to be put. Line 8
specifies that subdirectory.

Smith allows for user defined tests, but there are some defaults built in, which
we will examine here.

----
smith pdfs
----

This tells smith to generate pdfs of each test file for each font for each smart
font technology. That's quite a few for eaches, but it means that you can look
at any particular font and its smart rendering technology for each test. The
files end up in `buildlinux2/tests` based on the value of `TESTRESULTSDIR`.

So for example, the test file riwordsu-short.txt will generate 4 pdf files:
for the regular font: riwordsu-short_loma_ot.pdf, riwordsu-short_loma_gr.pdf and
for the bold font: riwordsu-short_loma-bold_ot.pdf and
riwordsu-short_loma-bold_gr.pdf. The `_ot` extension is used for OpenType
rendered texts and `_gr` for the graphite rendered texts. The texts are rendered
using XeTeX.

The other file in the tests directory is `patani-malay.htxt`. The `h` in htxt
tells smith to preprocess the file to convert strings of the form \uxxxx into
the corresponding Unicode character before rendering. This makes it easier to
create test files.

Line 17 is an important line for OpenType testing since it specifies which
script to use when running the OpenType shaping engine.

Another aspect of testing is regression testing. Can we find out what has
changed between this font and a known good version? The way this works is that
we store known good versions of the fonts and then have smith run tests against
both fonts and compare the results. The default directory to keep the font files
in is `standards/`.

----
smith test
----

The results end up in the `RESULTSDIR/regression` directory as `.log` files. If
there are no differences, the files are 0 length.

==== font6 - More Tests ====

Font testing is not limited to just the inbuilt test types. Smith supports the
integration of other test programs as you the user desires, so long as they are
command line based and report generators.
