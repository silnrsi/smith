== Directory Structure ==

Having a good layout for all the different files in a script project is very helpful.

Ideally this document would have a live project to illustrate the ideas, but for now a description is all there is.

=== Create Working Area ===

Create a directory to work in. We will use the directory `work\`. You can call this directory whatever you want and put it wherever you like, just remember to adjust the following instructions accordingly.

=== Script Projects ===

While it isn't necessary to follow the script project directory structure when using the font template build system, it is a useful directory structure.

fonts/::
    Contains one directory per font project in this script

keyboards/::
    Contains one directory per keyboard layout collection

mappings/::
    Contains one directory per legacy encoding. Inside that is any mapping tables and a sample font in that encoding.

wsis/::
    Each directory under here corresponds to a particular language that uses script. The directory name is the RFC4646bis code for the language. Each language directory in its turn contains other directories:

Words/:::
    This directory contains Unicode encoded wordlist files

cldr/:::
    This directory contains any LDML files for this language in this writing system

Toolbox/:::
    This directory contains any Toolbox `.lng` files for this language and script in Unicode. Non Unicode files are stored under a corresponding directory in the appropriate `mappings` directory.

Texts/:::
    Contains sample texts in the language, including `.pdf` to show how the text should be rendered.
