of the encoding and use of the fonts. Here are some basic hints:

Encoding: 
The fonts are encoded according to Unicode, so your application must support
Unicode text in order to access letters other than the standard alphabet.
Most Windows applications provide basic Unicode support. You will, however,
need some way of entering Unicode text into your document.

Foo does not include any keyboarding helps or utilities. If you 
cannot use the built-in keyboards of the operating system, you should 
install the appropriate keyboard and input method for the characters of the 
language you wish to use. You will need to install the appropriate keyboard and 
input method for the characters of the language you wish to use. 

Rendering:

Graphite and OpenType. To take advantage of the advanced typographic 
capabilities of this font, you must be using applications that provide an
adequate level of support for Graphite or OpenType.
