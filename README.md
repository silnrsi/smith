## Smith

smith is a Python-based framework for building, testing and maintaining WSI
(Writing Systems Implementation) components such as fonts and keyboards. It is
based on waf.
Smith orchestrates and integrates various tools and utilities to make a
standards-based open font design and production workflow easier to manage.

Building a font involves numerous steps and various programs, which, if done by
hand, would be prohibitively slow. Even working out what those steps are can
take a lot of work. Smith uses a dedicated file at the root of the project (the
file is python-based) to allow the user to describe how to build the font. By
chaining the different build steps intelligently, smith reduces build times to
seconds rather than minutes or hours, and makes build, test, fix, repeat cycles
very manageable. By making these processes repeatable, including for a number
of fonts at the same time, your project can be shared with others simply, or -
better yet - it can be included in a CI (Continuous Integration) system. This
allows for fonts (and their various source formats) to truly be libre/open
source software and developed with open and collaborative methodologies.

### Documentation

The manual (including a step-by-step tutorial) is in
[docs/smith](docs/smith/manual.asc).

### Installation

The standard `pip install .` will install just the smith packages and commands,
but will not install all the other font tooling which smith will search for
when `smith configure` is run.

To get the complete toolchain, follow the more descriptive step-by-step guide on [https://silnrsi.github.io/silfontdev/](http://silnrnsi.github.io/silfontdev/)

#### VM profiles (vagrant)
The current VM (Virtual Machine) installation files (using Vagrant) are in
[vm-install](vm-install).  These files make it easier to use smith (and its
various components) on macOS, Windows or Ubuntu.
Simply copy the files to the root of your project and run ``vagrant up``.

#### Docker image/container
Still in development in other branches like docker-focal.
